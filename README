Tk::Wizard - Wizard GUI Framework
=================================

IMPORTANT CHANGE(S) FROM PREVOUS VERSION(S)

As of Tk::Wizard version 2.044 (distribution version 2.111),
the -width and -height arguments to blank_frame() are applied
to the CONTENT AREA ONLY, not to the entire Wizard window.
Use the new Tk::Wizard::Sizer module (included with this distro)
to semi-automatically recalculate what you should pass in the
-width and -height arguments.

INSTALLATION

This module can be installed in the normal perl way, such as:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Tk::Wizard"

or, unpack the archive and in the new folder execute the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make all test
   make install

If you are on Windows you might have to use nmake instead of make.

If you set environment variable TEST_INTERACTIVE to any non-zero value,
some of the tests might pause and you will have to click the "Next" button
several times to get through them.

DESCRIPTION

In the context of this namespace, a Wizard is defined as a graphic user
interface (GUI) that presents information, and possibly performs tasks,
step-by-step via a series of different pages.  Pages (or 'screens', or
'Wizard frames') may be chosen logically depending upon user input.

The "Tk::Wizard" module automates a large part of the creation of a
wizard program to collect information and then perform some complex task
based upon it.

The wizard feel is largly based upon the Microsoft(TM,etc) wizard style:
the default is similar to that found in Microsoft Windows 95; a more
Windows 2000-like feel is also supported (see the "-style" entry in
"WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS".)  Subclassing the module to provide different
look-and-feel is highly encouraged: please see "NOTES ON SUB-CLASSING
Tk::Wizard".

NB: THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALPHA SOFTWARE.  ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME!
